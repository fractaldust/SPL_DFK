Name of QuantLet : 00-1-kfold_cv

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Performs n different k-fold cross validations, where n is the amount of different variations of settings for the neural network. Uses parallel computing to decrease runtime. Calculates loss as a measure of performance of neural network. In order to find best settings of neural network.

Keywords : cross validation, tuning, neural network, parallel computing,

Datafile : 

Input : tr.v - data.table, subset with tau-category=v
        k    -  numeric, dimension of cross validation
        parameters - list, variations of different parameters for neural network

Output : results.par - n*k matrix, where every element is a list of results of the performance of the model
