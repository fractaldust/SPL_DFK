Name of QuantLet : nnet_tuning_graph

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Plots the results of parameter tuning for neural network. 1st plot - 3*2=6 subplots for the six tau-categories, 2nd plot - combined results (in terms of tau-categories) to evaluate performance of neural network. Optimal/tuned settings are when loss is minimal (maximum of negative loss). 

Keywords : graph, plot, evaluation
