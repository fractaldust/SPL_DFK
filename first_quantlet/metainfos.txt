Author : Damiano Ferrari [New], Franziska Wehrmann [New], Konstantin Haeusler [New]

Datafile : known-unknown-data.RData, Decompose_Dataset.R, helperfunctions.R, 00-2-rep_cv.R, 00-3-nnet_DataPrep.R, 

Input : m              : m-times repeated c.v. (different randomness)
        k              : k-fold c.v.
        parameters     : parameters for tuning
        tau_candidates : thresholds to transform prediction (probability to 0/1), used to calculate loss function

Output : cv.list.f, cv.list.i, cv.list.iu, cv.list.u : lists, results of m times repeated, k-fold cross validation for n different sets of parameters for neural network for decomposed subsets .f, .i, .iu, .u




Name of QuantLet : nnet_tuning_graph

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Plots the results of parameter tuning for neural network. 1st plot: 3*2=6 subplots for the six tau-categories, 2nd plot: combined results (in terms of tau-categories) to evaluate performance of neural network. Optimal/tuned settings are when loss is minimal (maximum of negative loss). 

Keywords : graph, plot, evaluation

Datafile : cv_list-nnet-tuning.RData

Input : cv.list : list, results of m times repeated, k-fold cross validation for n different sets of parameters for neural network

Output : graphs as pdf




Name of QuantLet : item_retrate_graph

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Plots to evaluate artificially created feature item_retrate. 1st plot: Distribution of item_retrate in known data set together with the return probability of each category ’very low’ to ’very high’ and ’unknown’. 2nd plot: Distribution of item_retrate in known data set comparte to dist. in unknown data set. 

Keywords : plot, histogram, graph

Datafile : known-unknown-data.RData

Input : 

Output : graphs as pdf



Name of QuantLet : Decompose_Dataset

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Decomposes data set according to the quality of the features item_retrate and user_retrate for the models. Since the dirty levels 'unknown' and 'new' carry different information than the pure categories 'very low' to 'very high', they should not be treated equally by the model. Therefore the data set is decomposed according to the dirty/pure levels. When in the subset only remain dirty levels of one feature, the column of the feature is deleted. 

Keywords : data cleaning, decomposition

Author : Damiano Ferrari [New], Franziska Wehrmann [New], Konstantin Haeusler [New]

Datafile : 

Input : known   : data set for training
        unknown : data set for prediction

Output : known.f, known.i, known.iu, known.u, unknown.f, unknown.i, unknown.iu, unknown.u : clean subsets where .f: full model, .i: model without item_retrate, .iu: model without item_retrate and user_retrate, .u: model without user_retrate
