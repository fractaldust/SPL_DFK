Name of QuantLet : Decompose_Dataset

Published in : Statistical programming languages - Student Project on ''Ecommerce'' 

Description : Decomposes data set according to the quality of the features item_retrate and user_retrate for the models. Since the dirty levels 'unknown' and 'new' carry different information than the pure categories 'very low' to 'very high', they should not be treated equally by the model. Therefore the data set is decomposed according to the dirty/pure levels. When in the subset only remain dirty levels of one feature, the column of the feature is deleted. 

Keywords : data cleaning, decomposition

Datafile :

Input : known   - data set for training
        unknown - data set for prediction

Output : known.f, known.i, known.iu, known.u, unknown.f, unknown.i, unknown.iu, unknown.u - clean subsets where .f - full model, .i - model without item_retrate, .iu - model without item_retrate and user_retrate, .u - model without user_retrate
